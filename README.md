FastBuy(censored secret)

FastBuy was a service that would allow users to search for products of any kind, with price ranges and other parameters, and return the best possible item on either Amazon or eBay(users choice) using an internal algorithm. This project generated revenue through the Amazon affiliate programs and eBay partner programs.
